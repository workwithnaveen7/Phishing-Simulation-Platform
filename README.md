# Phishing-Simulation-Platform

This project is about educating users to prevent phishing attacks

it sends messsages to the user's mail id... stating that there account is compromised and to verify there account by clicking a link
that link will redirect them to a fake google's login page created by me... the credentials entered by them will be sent to my mail id and they will be pop uped with an image stating "you have been phished"

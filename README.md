# 🎣 Phishing Simulation Platform

### 🚨 Educate. Protect. Empower.

Welcome to the Phishing Simulation Platform—a powerful and interactive tool designed to educate users about the dangers of phishing attacks. In a world where cyber threats are just a click away, this platform helps users recognize and avoid phishing traps by giving them a safe, hands-on experience.

### 🔍 What is Phishing?

Phishing is one of the most common cyber threats, where attackers disguise themselves as trustworthy entities to steal sensitive information like usernames, passwords, and credit card details. Our platform simulates this scenario to teach users how to spot the red flags before it's too late.

### 💡 How It Works

* The Setup: The platform sends a realistic email to the user's inbox, cleverly disguised as a security alert. The message warns them that their account has been compromised and urges them to verify their account by clicking a link.

* The Trap: Clicking the link takes the user to a fake login page, which looks like a legitimate Google sign-in page. But don’t worry—this is all part of the learning experience!

* The Phish: Once the user enters their credentials, the data is captured and sent securely to you (the ethical hacker). Immediately after, a friendly pop-up reveals the truth: "You have been phished!"

* The Lesson: The user is then redirected to a page that explains what just happened, providing them with tips and best practices to avoid falling for phishing attacks in the future.

### 🎯 Why This Matters
Phishing is responsible for over 90% of data breaches. By simulating a real-world attack in a controlled environment, users learn how to protect themselves without suffering any real harm. The Phishing Simulation Platform is not just a tool—it's an educational experience that empowers users to be more vigilant online.
